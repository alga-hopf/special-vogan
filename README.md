## Special Vogan diagrams

In this project we consider a combinatorial property of Vogan diagrams, namely *speciality*. This properties may be studied directly through specialVoganDiagrams.sage, which encodes a mathematical algorithm that determines speciality. On the other hand, one may try to study this property by deep learning techniques. For the experiments with deep learning techniques we refer to the folder **deep-learning**, while the direct code sits in **direct**.
